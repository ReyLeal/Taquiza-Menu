The taquiza experience is an app that lets you cycle through menu options from Taquiza's menu. Once the user is ready to order, it will let you place your order. Once the user submitted their order, they are prompted to respond if they want the check or not. If they would like their check, they are shown their total with a list of the items they ordered with their prices. And then they are prompted to give their tip percentage. Once they are done with tip, their total bill is displayed with their tip, tax, and overall total bill.

In the future, I would like to refacor it more, so that I can make it easier to read and more concise. I would use classes to help with the refactoring. I would also like to add a feature that has the user re-enter their order if one of their items is not on the menu. Right now, if their order is not on the menu, it just ignores that item and does not add it to the bill.
